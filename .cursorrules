# Cursor AI Assistant Rules

## Core Principles
- **NEVER** create documentation unless explicitly requested
- **NEVER** write tests or test endpoints unless explicitly requested
- **NEVER** create git commits automatically
- **NEVER** use Docker unless specifically prompted
- Keep responses concise - minimize or omit summaries at task completion 

## Development Workflow

### When building a UI
- **ALWAYS** use Shadcn and / or Tailwind
- **ALWAYS** look for similar pages or components and re-use them and/or their style

### Before/After Making Changes
1. Check existing packages before installing new ones - prefer reusing installed dependencies
2. Check if there are existing components you can re-use
3. Run `npm run build` to identify specific build errors before attempting fixes
4. Run `npm run lint` to identify specific linting errors before attempting fixes
5. Run `npx prisma migrate` after you've made changes to the database schema
6. After running `npx prisma migrate` you **ALWAYS** run `npx prisma generate`
7. After creating a new *route* don't forget to register it

### TypeScript Guidelines
- **NEVER** use type `any` - use `unknown`, specific types, or generics instead
- Use template literals (`${variable}`) instead of string concatenation with `+=`
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
- Enable strict mode compliance

### Git Workflow (when requested)
- Review previous commits to match the existing commit message style
- Always review the diff before suggesting commit messages
- Follow conventional commit format if established in the repository
- If there are multiple (unrelated) features in one commit, consider splitting it up into several commits

### Code Quality
- Review all code changes at task completion for:
  - Type safety and proper TypeScript usage
  - Consistent code style with existing codebase
  - Removal of unused imports and variables
  - Proper error handling

## Context Information
- Current year: 2025
- Target environment: Modern JavaScript/TypeScript runtime

## Override Clause
These rules are **MANDATORY** unless the user explicitly requests an exception. When an exception is requested, acknowledge the override before proceeding.
